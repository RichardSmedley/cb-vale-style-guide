[NOTE]
--
This is not implemented with a full Markdown parser.
See link:https://github.com/asciidoctor/kramdown-asciidoc/issues/7[issue]
with a link to the "naive series of regexes" used as starting point.

(And note that we use Open 
link:https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/blocks/delimited/#summary-of-structural-containers[structural context], 
with `--` delimiters, and headings don't work inside these.)

This feature is intended for handling OpenAPI specs, which can contain Markdown,
however openapi-generator has link:https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/issues/11396[poor Asciidoc handling],
so instead we add the block delimiters in the template, and let the block filter handle it.
